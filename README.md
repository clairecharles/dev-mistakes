  dev mistakes
</h1>

## What this is
An archive of mistakes devs have made in the job search and on job. Learn so you can avoid the same.

## Reason for this repo
There is enough documentation of success, a lot of "how I joined a top notch company", "how to ace an interview" but very little about mistakes devs have made along their journeys. Let's document mistakes so people following the same paths can try to do better from the start.

## 1. Selection of Tech Stack
MERN | MEAN | Ruby on Rails | Python/Flask | Python/Django | Java/Spring Boot | Kotlin/Spring Boot | Flutter -> The list goes on.
### üî∂ Reason for selection

There are several reasons why devs select the stack they end up using - a few of those reasons include: <br />

- Ease of learning - You want to build something fast
- Size and activity of community behind the stack - You will get stuck building projects because of a bug, no idea how to do something etc. Whatever the reason, the community can determine how fast you find answers.
- Demand for the stack - opportunities and consequently money come into the mix. You want to learn something that will help you get a job fast.
- What you want to build - If you want to build mobile apps, you are in luck because the options are few. But if you want to build for the web, the options can be overwhelming.
- Fun - Many of us have learned things just because they are fun. That's the reason I tried out Python and Kotlin ( fun syntax )

Make sure you learn the right stack depending on which reason weighs most for you. If you are looking for a fruitful financially stable career, choose a stack that will give you the best opportunities for that.

  It may be hard to learn but it would be worth it in the long run - for this reason, I should have started with Java/Spring Boot way earlier in my career instead of going for python. Don't get me wrong, Python is great but timing for learning it wasn't right for me - may be it is for you.
