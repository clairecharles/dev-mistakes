# dev mistakes
An archive of mistakes devs have made in the job search and on job. Learn so you can avoid the same.

## reason for this repo
There is enough documentation of success, a lot of "how I joined a top notch company", "how to ace an interview" but very little about mistakes devs have made along their journeys. Let's document mistakes so people following the same paths can try to do better from the start.
